# Electricity-Demand-Forecasting

Our project, spearheaded by team members Anurag Thakur, Lirong Yi, Jonathon Anderson, and Nathan William, aims to develop new energy forecasting algorithms to address the evolving challenges in Australia's electricity sector. These challenges have been compounded by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has rendered traditional forecasting methods obsolete, as well as by the increasing adoption of electric vehicles, which adds a new layer of uncertainty to power demand. Our goal is to create accurate and economical forecasting models that will help power companies optimize their operations and reduce costs.

We plan to take a multi-faceted approach to develop our algorithms, incorporating various environmental factors such as cloud cover, air pressure, temperature, and wind conditions. We will also account for changes in consumption patterns over time, specifically focusing on shifts that occurred before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our project will be supported by extensive research, which will be detailed in the report, to justify our choices of specific algorithms, software, and hardware. We have also laid out a structured project plan, complete with objectives, timelines, and risk mitigation strategies to ensure smooth execution.

Team communication will be pivotal for successful project management, and we'll actively monitor each member's progress on their assigned tasks. On the technical side, the report will elaborate on the datasets we're using for training and validation, and offer an overview of how various software and hardware components will be integrated into a cohesive system. We will also include a user-friendly UI to share our findings with stakeholders. Finally, our project will feature rigorous testing phases to confirm the quality and reliability of our predictive algorithms. This summary serves to offer stakeholders a concise and comprehensive overview of our project, its importance, and how we plan to achieve our objectives.
